# TicTacToe

Learning about good design practices by building tictactoe with a guide from [MrPowers](https://github.com/MrPowers/tic_tac_toe) and adding my own implementation.

## Installation

To run the game, type in your console 

```ruby
ruby run_game.rb
```

## Tests

To run the tests, type in your console

```ruby
rspec ./spec/[<class_file_name_spec>].rb

## Future add-ons

* Time limit on response
* More intuitive UI
